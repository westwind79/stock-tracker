          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-3 text-slate-700">
            <p>
              <strong>SEC Form 4</strong> is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
              whenever there is a change in the holdings of company insiders. Workday executives, directors, and 
              beneficial owners (those who own more than 10% of company stock) must file Form 4 within two business 
              days of any insider transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes Form 4 filings one of the most timely and reliable sources of insider trading data. 
              Our tracker pulls directly from the SEC EDGAR system to ensure you have access to the most current 
              Workday insider trading information available.
